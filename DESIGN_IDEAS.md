# Design Improvement Ideas

## Visual Enhancements

- [ ] Implement a featured review carousel or hero section for standout reviews
- [ ] Add reading progress indicators or visual badges for book categories/genres
- [x] ~~Add book spine designs as decorative elements between sections~~ (Won't implement - doesn't fit site aesthetic)

## Typography & Readability

- [x] Increase contrast on secondary text (dates, metadata) for better accessibility
- [x] Add drop caps to review opening paragraphs for visual interest
- [ ] Implement better quote styling with larger pull quotes for memorable passages

## Interactive Elements

- [ ] Add filtering/sorting options for reviews (by rating, year, genre)
- [ ] Implement a "quick view" modal for book details without full navigation
- [ ] Add reading time estimates for longer reviews

## Color & Visual Interest

- [ ] Introduce an accent color for CTAs and interactive elements (deep burgundy or forest green)
- [ ] Add subtle gradients or patterns to section backgrounds for depth

## Performance & UX

- [ ] Add skeleton loaders during content loading for smoother perceived performance
- [ ] Implement infinite scroll or pagination for review archives
- [ ] Add a sticky "back to top" button for long pages
