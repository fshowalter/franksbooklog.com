They kill the son and escape but not before the old woman puts a curse on them. The families return home, eager to put the horrific trip behind them, but strange things start happening. Small things at first. One slips in the shower. Another gets cramps in both legs while swimming in the pool. But soon, the coincidences begin to pile up. People end up in the hospital. Or worse. Soon, the remaining unharmed members travel back to the mountains to deal with the witch and remove the curse.</p>",
