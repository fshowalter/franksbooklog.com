Though most of tales are EC Comics style setups for twist endings, they're well executed, and the others such as the opening "Jerusalem's Lot", which borrows from Bram Stoker's _The Lair of the White Worm_, and the closing, "The Woman in the Room", about a man's struggle to deal with his cancer-ridden mother's slow death, are outstanding, the latter especially so given that we now know that it's essentially an autobiographical story.
