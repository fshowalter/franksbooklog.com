Rick Rubin, the famed music producer of such disparate acts as The Beastie Boys, Slayer, Tom Petty, and Johnny Cash, proffers a meditation on creativity.

A pleasing listen thanks to Rubin's almost Bob Ross-like barritone, and devoid of the woo-woo spiritual handwaving present in many such treatises. Well, almost, as Rubin does include this annecdote:

> When my appendix burst, the doctor who diagnosed it insisted that I go to the hospital immediately to have it removed. I was told there were no other options. I found myself in a nearby bookstore. Standing out on a table in the front was a new book by Dr. Andrew Weil. I picked it up and let it fall open. The first passage my eyes went to said: if a doctor wants to remove a part of your body, and they tell you it has no function, don’t believe this. The information I needed was made available to me in that moment. And I still have my appendix.

That digression aside, Rubin offers insight gained through his years helping creatives realize their visions. At his best, he's insightful.

> A point of view is different from having a point.
>
> A point is an idea intentionally expressed. A point of view is the perspective—conscious and unconscious—through which the work emerges.
>
> What causes us to notice a piece of art is rarely the point being made. We are drawn to the way an artist’s filter refracts ideas, not to the ideas themselves.

My biggest gripe is his reluctance to cite real-world examples. I respect the decision to eschew the tell-all autobiography, but grounding these lessons in real-world examples would have helped them resonate.

Consider how he talks of creatives leaning toward one of two catagories:

> Experimenters are partial to dreaming and play, finding it more difficult to complete and release their work.
>
> Finishers are the mirror image, a backward reflection. They move quickly to the end point with immediate clarity. They are less interested in exploring the possibilities and alternatives that the Experimentation and Craft phases can suggest.
>
> Each might find it helpful to borrow from the other.

This resonated as I lean hard to the experimentor side. I view finishers with a kind of awe, but Rubin illustrated how Finishers suffer in their own right, struggling to realize a work's full potential versus executing the minimum and moving on to the next project. Insightful, but real-world examples (shared with the artists' permissions, of course) would have moved it beyond the abstract.

He offers practical tips for both camps, in additional to strategies for avoiding other creative pitfalls. To avoid "demo-itis", a condition where an artist can't move past their first draft, he suggests:

> Unless actively working to make something better, avoid listening to it, reading it, playing it, looking at it, or showing it to friends. Work as far forward as you can while crafting and then step away, without repetitively consuming the unfinished work. By not accepting the work-in-progress as the standard version, we leave room for growth, change, and development to continue.

Great advice. But Rubin's insistence on dealing in abstracts frustrates. Compare this to Stephen King's On Writing, which also featured creative strategies, but tied them to King's own works, detailing how he almost lost The Stand.

Still, Rubin offered an insight the prolific King couldn't:

> Hanging on to your work is like spending years writing the same entry in a diary. Moments and opportunities are lost. The next works are robbed of being brought to life.

As someone who struggles to publish these very reviews, that resonated. I suspect Rubin a raconteur, and might have found more enjoyment in a rollicing memoir, or even a techncial deep-dive into the assorted production techniques he's employed. But, as entertaining as those reads might have been, I'm glad Rubin wrote the book he did, if only for that paragraph.
