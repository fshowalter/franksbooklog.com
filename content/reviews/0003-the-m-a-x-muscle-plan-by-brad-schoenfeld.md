_Peter Cushing: A Life in Film_ chronicles the horror icon's life via his appearances on stage and screen. Biographer David Miller's focus on Cushing's professional life differentiates this work from Cushing's two autobiographies. Miller's disciplined approach feels, at times, less like the story of Cushing's life, and more like a reference guide to his career.

That's not necessarily a bad thing. Among the better tidbits: Cushing came close enough to starring in Lucio Fulci's _The Black Cat (<>)_ to have annotated the script with notes on his performance.

Miller's research is thorough, and he likes to show it. But do we really care about the exact dates that the play <>, with Cushing as <>, opened and closed?

Finally, fair warning: there's little sympathy for readers outside the UK. I'll admit to having to look up what <> meant. Couldn't he have just said 'bingo'?
