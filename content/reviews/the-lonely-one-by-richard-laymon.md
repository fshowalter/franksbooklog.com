At the Santa Monica pier, Doreen rides alone on the merry-go-round until a handsome young man named Ron takes an interest. Despite her warnings that anyone who gets close to her ends up dead, Ron persists, convincing her to let him win her a stuffed animal at the carnival games. As he tries, she flees and hides beneath the pier. There, a vagrant assaults her. Ron comes to her rescue--only to reveal that the attacker is the least of his problems.

_The Lonely One_ is another of Laymon’s stories published in the FastBack series of books. With a focus on action and a low vocabulary, the series strove to foster an interest in reading for pleasure in young adults. To keep the words-per-page low, the books were passport-sized and came in just under thirty pages. Laymon’s terse writing style proves a natural fit for the format, and you never feel like he’s “dumbing down” his material.

This proves one of Laymon's superior FastBack entries. The location--a pier carnival at night--provides great atmosphere, which Laymon would revisit for his later novel, <span data-work-slug="funland-by-richard-laymon">_Funland_</span>, a work that also features a seaside carnival with menacing vagrants lurking beneath its pier. Doreen's ominous warnings establish tension early, while also lending her character nuance. This story’s obligatory twist is also well-handled, with Laymon offering ample hints, like Ron’s necklace, and Doreen refusing the cotton candy, without telegraphing the reveal. It's not a great work, but unlike most of the FastBack stories, it would feel at home in a Laymon collection.
