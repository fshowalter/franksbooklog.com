Picking where _Record Play Pause_ ended, this second volume of memoriors from drummer Stephen Morris chronicle's New Order's rise to super-stardom and the tensions that tore it apart.

After lead singer Ian Curtis's suicide, the band faced an identity crisis. They toyed with being their label, Factory's, house band. But playing other people's music wasn't for them. So they resolved to remain their own band, rechristened New Order. But who would do the singing?

Most of the duties fell to guitarist Bernard Sumner, with some songs done by bassist Peter Hook. To allow Bernard to sing more, manager Rob Gretton suggested adding a forth member to the group--Stephen's girlfriend, Gillian Morris.

Shocked at first, the band warmed to the idea, and Gillian joined.

> Gillian’s first experience of the recording process and Martin Hannett’s unconventional production techniques was our re-recording of ‘Ceremony’, starting what would become a New Order habit of confusing the record-buying public.

The quarted gelled and began accumulating new songs as Morris continued his fascination wih bleeding edge tech. One such piece of kit was the Clap Trap.

> It could clap slowly or it could clap incredibly fast but... ‘Steve, it’s fucking useless.’

The band's songwriting process also evolved. Without Ian to write the lyrics, the band took turns. Morris had a system.

> I found two or three tins of Carlsberg Special Brew could be quite inspirational when it came to the composition of words. The deciphering of my scrawl the next morning, though, was a bit problematical. As to what these words were about or actually meant I had no recollection.
