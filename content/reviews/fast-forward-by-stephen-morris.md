Picking where _Record Play Pause_ ended, this second volume of memoriors from drummer Stephen Morris chronicle's New Order's rise to super-stardom and the tensions that tore it apart.

After lead singer Ian Curtis's suicide, the band faced an identity crisis. They toyed with being their label, Factory's, house band. But playing other people's music wasn't for them. So they resolved to remain their own band, rechristened New Order. But who would do the singing?

Most of the duties fell to guitarist Bernard Sumner, with some songs done by bassist Peter Hook. To allow Bernard to sing more, manager Rob Gretton suggested adding a forth member to the group--Stephen's girlfriend, Gillian Morris.

Shocked at first, the band warmed to the idea, and Gillian joined.

> Gillian’s first experience of the recording process and Martin Hannett’s unconventional production techniques was our re-recording of ‘Ceremony’, starting what would become a New Order habit of confusing the record-buying public.

The quarted gelled and began accumulating new songs as Morris continued his fascination wih bleeding edge tech. One such piece of kit was the Clap Trap.

> ‘And what does it do?’
>
> ‘It makes clapping noises.’
>
> ‘And why did you think that might be useful? We’ve all got hands, even Rob.’
>
> ‘Well, I, er, um, thought . . .’
>
> The device did not garner approval from my fellow musicians. They were immune to its charm and potential.T hey were immune to its charm and potential. The box would sit there clapping away to itself in what was, I finally had to admit, a particularly monotonous and annoying manner.
>
> It could clap slowly or it could clap incredibly fast but... ‘Steve, it’s fucking useless.’

The band's songwriting process also evolved. Without Ian to write the lyrics, the band took turns. Morris had a system.

> I found two or three tins of Carlsberg Special Brew could be quite inspirational when it came to the composition of words. The deciphering of my scrawl the next morning, though, was a bit problematical. As to what these words were about or actually meant I had no recollection.
>
> ‘ICB’, ‘Chosen Time’, ‘Procession’, ‘Cries and Whispers’ mk2 and ‘Mesh’ mk2 were all products of my Carlsberg-fuelled scribblings.

Stephen's early-adopter techincal inclinations extended to home video. He purchased an unwieldy "portable" VHS video recorder and camera. While film-maker may not have been in his future, he:

> was also building up a substantial collection of what I considered classic films taped off the TV and, of course, a selection of stuff in the ‘video nasty’ genre: Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Spectre and Caligula along with a pirate copy of A Clockwork Orange were particular faves. Oh, and everything I could find by John Waters, Desperate Living being essential viewing. These were sourced as a rule from the central hub of eighties entertainment – the dodgy corner-shop video-rental emporium.

I bring this up because I didn't recognize the _Spectre_ title. Turns out this was the UK title for <span data-imdb-id="tt0080464">_The Boogey Man_</span> which was shot, in part, in my hometown. Small world.

In other video-related affairs, Morris reveals the track "Video 5-8-6" came from an idea to show something on the video screens behind the band when they played Factory's club, the Haçienda. So they padded the track '5-8-6' out to twenty-two minutes, and Bernard, Gillian, and Steven cut together a video to match from a pile of cult VHS tapes, one of which was <span data-imdb-id="tt0080354">_Alligator_</span>.

> Over the years, the track now known as ‘Video 5-8-6’ or ‘Prime 5-8-6’ has become some sort of art thing rather than the musical accompaniment to a man being eaten by an alligator, which is always how I remember it.

As the 80s progressed, the band's musical inspriations changed. Prog and rock gave way to Italian disco and USA house music. The era of the 12-inch dance track, but something wasn't right.

> I was listening to these tracks on a hi-fi in a tiny bedroom in a nice house on a suburban street in Macclesfield. The same way I listened to everything. Although this was very satisfying for nearly everything rock, psych, country, punk and prog, it was not the environment that the 12-inch extended dance mix was designed for.

As New Order's music began to reflect this, Morris noticed a shift in band's audience.

> In the very early days our audience seemed to consist largely of Joy Division fans come to pay their respects. Generally, these adopted the look they thought typified Ian Curtis (this they assumed from photographs of Ian and Joy Division): short hair and grey raincoats. They didn’t smile much. They were mostly men.
>
> They had a look that said, ‘Sorry for your loss’ and ‘Why did he do it?’ Their number dwindled when Gillian joined the band, with a few diehards finally giving up the ghost after hearing ‘Everything’s Gone Green’.
>
> ‘It’s a shame really but they’re not...’
>
> ‘How dare they have fun in their grief and misery?’
>
> I enjoyed annoying these people as a matter of principle.

But it was the arrival of a key piece of tech, the Emu Emulator, along with the Oberheim DMX drum machine, that propelled the band to stardom.

> To learn what the actual potential of all this new equipment was we set about writing a tune, as much another experiment as anything. It was inspired by the always inspirational Donna Summer’s ‘Our Love’, Shep Pettibone’s remix of Sharon Redd’s ‘Beat The Street’ and very loosely based on the arrangement of ‘Dirty Talk’ by Klein and MBO. We had a cup of tea and got straight to work. It took quite a while.

The result, "Blue Monday" sold hundreds of thousands of copies and made Factory a little over a hundred thousand pounds. No, the label did not lose money on every copy.

Morris dispells another myth:

> Another ‘Blue Monday’ legend is that it is the bestselling 12-inch of all time. An accolade indeed, but it’s open to question. Don’t let that spoil a good story though. Let’s just say it almost certainly is the bestselling 12-inch of all time and always will be, and move on.

The bands ascention to super-stardom takes its toll. Morris recounts a layover in Thialand which saw him get drunk and pick a spiteful fight with Gillian whose only crime was astonishing the locals with her short skirt and dyed red hair. Meanwhile their drunk manager, Rob Gretton, insisted on buying the suit in the window of a shop, shouting at the propritor, "How much for the suit, mate?" to which the owner, kept replying, "No ticket!" until their roadie, the soberest among them realized what was happening and turned to Rob.

> ‘Rob, we’ve got to go. It’s a fucking cleaners!’
