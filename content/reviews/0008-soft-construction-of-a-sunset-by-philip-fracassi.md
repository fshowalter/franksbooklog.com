Tom receives a frantic pre-dawn call from long-time friend Marcus. Arriving at Marcus’s apartment, Tom discovers a surreal horror. Fracassi’s _Twilight Zone_ style take on Uri Geller’s spoon bending trick proves entertaining. His deft description of dreamscapes and the surreal echo Clive Barker, though he stops short of the big reveal, leaving it to our imagination.
