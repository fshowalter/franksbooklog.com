The sound of breaking glass wakes Goldie. It's dark. She hears footsteps in the hall. Heavy breathing. Someone's in the house.

_The Intruder_ is another of Laymon's entries in the FastBack series of books. The books were small--about the size of a passport--and just under 30 pages. With a focus on action and a low vocabulary, the series strove to foster an interest in reading for pleasure in young adults.

There's a plot twist here that Laymon cannibalized for his later novel, <span data-work-slug="no-sanctuary-by-richard-laymon">_No Sanctuary_</span>. But it's a good twist, even if I did see it coming.
