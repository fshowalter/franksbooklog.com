Jacobs offers an insiders point of view into Sinatra's life beginning just before his comeback performance in _From Here to Eternity_ and ending in the aftermath of his troubled marriage to Mia Farrow.

While certainly salacious, the love Jacob's harbors for Mr. S. is evident, resulting in a raconteur tale that may not be the gospel truth, but is one hell of an enjoyable read.
