A strained intercostal muscle has me layed up from training, and I wanted motivation. This came recommended by Eric Helms on his Iron Culture podcast.

Draper proves a charming writer. His conversational style evokes Roger Ebert and Stephen King. Regarding his journey to the 1965 Mr. America stage:

> I took the long, serious road to get to New York, leaving New Jersey in the spring of ‘63, stopping off in Los Angeles for a few years and arriving at La Guardia International in mid-September of 1965. Gave me a chance to think and see the sights. They’ve got sunshine out West; The Beach Boys were right.

After a short autobiography, he delves into his training routines. His philosophy boils down to three things: consistency, hard work, and supersets. He loves supersets, but refrains from painting them as a secret sauce. A refreshing approach in a field littered with folks purporting to hold the "secret" to muscle building. That said, this section has little to recommend it over the multitude of similar works.

Given Draper's talent as a writer, I wish he'd focused more on his life story. Some of the book's best parts come at the end, where he offers disjointed snapshot memories including a memorable story of himself and Frank Zane pulling the emergency cord on a European train when they realized they were travelling the wrong direction.
